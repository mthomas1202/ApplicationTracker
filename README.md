"# ApplicationTracker" 
A program I created to allow me to visualize and keep track of the applications I have been sending out. The program reads from an excel file that I have been adding to with the information I need to keep track of. It takes this data and uploads it to an SQLite database with three tables: Application, Company, and Location. From this table, you are able to see a bubbleMap of where you have applied, a wordCloud of the positions you have applied for, a lineGraph to visualize when you are applying to jobs, and check through your emails to see if there had been any status changes regarding your applications.
